    <p class="about-p">Lauren Hom was very shy and creative in her youth. Her interest in lettering and design may have developed from her mother’s habit of spelling out her and her brother’s names with their afternoon snacks. She decided to pursue advertising due to its intersection of creativity and practicality. After some time in college, she found that her true passions lied in typography and lettering, but refused to change her major that far into the program. By the time she graduated, she had signed a book deal with the help of her hand lettering blog, Daily Dishonesty. After a few months in an advertising agency, she abandoned the field and began working full time as a freelance hand lettering artist and designer.  </p>

        <h3>early life</h3>
        <p class="early-life-p">
            Lauren Hom was born in Los Angeles, California on November 15th, 1990 to a loving mother and father. Her mother was a pediatric nurse and her father is the CFO of a small company that buys and sells precious metals. Hom is the oldest of two, with a brother three years younger than she is. She grew up in LA with her family, who has stayed local over the years.
            Throughout her youth, she was said to be very creative and super shy. Despite her parents vocations, Hom’s creativity was not a shock to her family. Her mother was very crafty and even hand-sewed her children’s Halloween costumes until they were about 12 years old. Additionally, her exposure and interest in lettering may have stemmed from her mother. Hom stated, “When I was a kid because my mom would make us afternoon snacks where she would cut our names, letters of our names out of slices of American cheese, and serve them to us with Ritz crackers.  And she'd like write our names and bubble letters on our lunch pails. I always joke that my introduction to lettering happened a lot sooner than I realized.”

        <h3>background</h3>
        <p class="background-p">Art was something she had always been interested in, but due to her families history, she felt a little pressure to pursue something more academic. When Hom set her mind to the creative field, her parents came at it with a loving skepticism. After some time, she had the realization that advertising may be the right path due to its intersection between practicality and creativity. She went to the School of Visual Arts in New York City and graduated with a BFA in advertising. In her second year of schooling, she took a Typography class and fell in love with lettering and design. The following year, she took a Communication Design class and unintentionally found her niche by crossing humor and food. In this class, she continuously enhanced her skills in lettering and design. Her professor even approached her to explain that she may be in the wrong major. Being a risk-adverse person, she refused to switch majors after 3 years into the advertising program. The professor continued her efforts, and even got Hom an internship with Louise Fili, a well known graphic designer. <br>
            <br>
            In her senior year of college, Hom created her hand lettering blog, Daily Dishonesty, in which she posted a little quote multiple times a week. Her blog blew up on the internet and by the time graduation rolled around, she was signing a book deal for her blog. Despite this success in graphic design, Hom continued her path into advertising. During her work day, Hom spent every free moment she had brainstorming and working on new pieces for the Daily Dishonesty blog and her upcoming book deal. This artistic side of her was much more fulfilling than her job at the advertising agency. After a few months, Hom was feeling very dissatisfied by the work she was doing but she was determined to complete a year in order to put it on her resume. A friend said “why does your advertising resume matter if you don’t want to work in advertising?” and this is what led Hom to put herself first and go forward with her artistic work.
