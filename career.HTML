    <p class="career-p">Lauren Hom’s career in hand lettering began before she even graduated college. She signed a book deal inspired by her blog, Daily Dishonesty, a few months before graduating. Despite this opportunity, she followed her BFA in advertising to an ad agency, but eight months later, she found herself dissatisfied with the field. She quit her job and began freelancing as a hand letterer. Her career has taken off from there and she has blossomed into a well known designer. </p>
