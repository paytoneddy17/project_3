    <h1>STYLE</h1>
    <p class="style-p">Lauren Hom’s style is most easily characterized by her use of bright color palettes, playful letterforms, and quirky copywriting. She has stated that her personal experiences are the biggest influence. Whether it be for quotes or inspiration. However, when on the hunt for new inspiration, the first place she looks is thrift and antique stores. A few professors from her college years have also influenced and nurtured her style into what it is today.

        <h3 class="style-subhead">inspiration</h3>
        <p class="inspo-p">Overall, her work is inspired by experience. She stated, “I went through a bad break up a few years ago and it inspired one of my favorite projects ever, Ex-Boyfriend Tears.” Aesthetically, she has expressed that her inspiration stems from colors, patterns, textures, and signage that she sees on her travels. Similarly, her favorite place to seek out inspiration is on vintage packaging from thrift stores.</p>

        <p class="quote">“Richard was the one who introduced me to lettering. I didn't know you could draw letters before that! He gave us a lot of really hands-on type of graphic exercises, and I try to do the same with my lettering students now.”
        <br>
        <br>
        “Richard had a really casual, lovely style of teaching, and I think what I take with me in my teaching is I don't have to pretend to sound smart. I can just talk about how I talk, and that can honestly be a more effective teaching method.”</p>

        <h4 class="what">Graphic Design Teacher</h4>
        <p class="quote">“The open assignments she gave to us really allowed us to take our own direction with the projects we wanted to make. She gave us the framework and then let us run wild and kind of guided our creativity, and that's what I try to do with my Passion to Paid class.”</p>
